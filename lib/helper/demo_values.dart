Frightened of having leaped out of their comfort zones into the daunting, yet promising world of possibilities that university has to offer, the naive freshman has only hope to console himself. However, LUMS does a great job at exceeding the freshman’s expectations of the dose of growth and emotions that await him.";
  static const String postdetail2 = "One of the biggest jumps of your life is probably from going to school to joining a college, LUMS, for example in my case. A lot of things change when that transition from a school kid to a college student happens, and you’re on your way to slowly becoming an individual adult (whether you liked it or not).However the change is not over yet, because you always learn new things, experience all kinds of new experiences and become a more evolved person all through college. Here are some things my first year at LUMS taught me: You’ll start giving zero shits for quizzes.Yup, you’ll begin to realize that quizzes don’t make or break your grade. Mids and finals are rather more important and many people just choose to rather focus on those. The more important thing, however, is learning and not just scoring on the grades. However don’t completely let loose, because failing all your quizzes is not a favorable situation either.";
  static const String postdetail3 = "Academic advisement is a relationship between advisor and student to support the student's educational and career success. Academic advisor provides guidance on academic policies and regulations, decision making rearding course selection and refer to resources available on campus offering academic and personal support.During the first semester, students develop a four year plan based on template provided as per their proposed major. The plan includes specific course requirements to be completed within a specific period of time. Four year plans must be approved by the academic advisor in order to enroll for subsequent semesters.";
